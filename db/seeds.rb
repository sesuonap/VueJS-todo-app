# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# Task.create(text: "Take out the garbage", completed: false)
# Task.create(text: "Make the bed", completed: false)
# Task.create(text: "Mow the lawn", completed: false)
# Task.create(text: "Buy groceries", completed: false)
# Task.create(text: "Feed the cat", completed: false)
